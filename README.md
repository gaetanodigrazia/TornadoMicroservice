I've to validate a library Idea that I've already implemented, so please share it if you can, it's free.

CHALLENGE

Consider that you're working on Spring Boot environment and you have to implement an endpoint that allow you to search an user by different parameters: 
simply get all, by firstname, by lastname, by first&last, by age, by weight, by age&weight, by ssn based on parameter you pass to the controller.

How would you implement the rest controller?


Do you trust me if I say that this is possible with ONE (more or less) single line of code?
